App for recording conversations (email, faxes etc.) with clients.

This is very simple app. It work like some kind of notebook - you can put here records about when, from what source and about what was conversation that you made (or letter that you received/sent).

For using as separate app should be added normal login system (now you can log in just through "/admin")
